The HTML code on the folder Retrato com Foto defines a web page that contains a div element with the class circular--portrait. This element contains two img elements. The first img element is a frame and the second img element is a photo. The frame is set as the background image of the div element. The photo is positioned in the center of the frame and is displayed as a circular image. The circular--portrait class defines the dimensions of the div element and the position of the photo within the frame. The border-radius property is used to create the circular appearance of the photo. The above CSS code is used to style the web page and create the circular appearance of the photo.
